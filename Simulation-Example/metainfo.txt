Description: Simulation of datasets for the estimation of the CATE. Different settings are possible, e.g random assignment, confounding (selection-bias), linear and non-linear dependencies.

The data structure has to be the following: 

* y = outcome variable
* d = treatment variable
* covariates = the covariates to map on d or y
* theta =  the true treatment effect (simulation study also includes)
